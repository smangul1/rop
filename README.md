# ROP: Read Origin Protocol


The ROP protocol is available for free download as a package that is easy to install and run.  It provides a one-command solution to to discover the source of all unmapped reads, which originated from complex RNA molecules, recombinant B and T cell receptors and microbial communities. 

ROP provides a flexible interface that allows users to perform analysis of interest, rather than running a full ROP analysis. For example,  `--microbiome` option allows to run only microbial analysis.
